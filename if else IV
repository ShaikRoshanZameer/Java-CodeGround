 Write a program to convert from upper case to lower case and vice versa of an alphabet and 
 print the old character and new character as shown in example (Ex: a->A, M->m).
 
 import java.util.*;

public class Charactercase{

 
public static void main(String []args){

Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("enter the character");
char one=sc.next().charAt(0);
     
if(Character.isUpperCase(one))
{
     
System.out.println("input character is "+one+" and in lower case, it is "+Character.toLowerCase(one));
}
    
else
    
{
       
System.out.println("input character is "+one+" and in upper case, it is "+Character.toUpperCase(one));
  
}
  
}
}
