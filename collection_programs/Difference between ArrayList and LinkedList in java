==>LinkedList is faster in add and remove, but slower in get. 

==>The time complexity comparison is as follows: 
      
          arraylist   linkedlist
get()       O(1)       O(n)
add()       O(1)       O(1)
remove()    O(n)       O(n)

==>ArrayList is faster than LinkedList if I randomly access its elements. Random access means "give me the nth element". 
   Why ArrayList is faster?

   ArrayList has direct references to every element in the list, so it can get the n-th element in constant time. 
   LinkedList has to traverse the list from the beginning to get to the n-th element.


==>LinkedList is faster than ArrayList for deletion.
   ArrayList's slower since the internal backing-up array needs to be reallocated.

   ArrayList is slower because it needs to copy part of the array in order to remove the slot that has become free.
